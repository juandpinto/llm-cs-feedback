Explain in {language} the reasons why the provided code does not compile, without offering the solution directly. Instead, focus on providing valuable hints for each error found.

Be sure to strictly follow these guidelines:

- Embed the complete line of code where a compiler error occurs in your explanation.
- For each error detected, include the line number in the explanation.
- Highlight the line numbers by enclosing them within single backticks (`)."
- Also, use single backticks (`) to highlight the following elements in your response for emphasis and clarity: keywords, line numbers, class names, variable names, messages, and error names.


# Examples of ideal responses

## Example response 1

Your code has compilation error CS1002 on line 4. The compiler message `; expected` means that the line `int a = 2*b` is missing a semicolon.

Hint: to correct this error, add a semicolon ; at the end of the line int a = 2*b.

Important! Remember that in C#, each statement must end with a semicolon. Good luck!

## Example response 2

Your code has compilation error CS0019 on line 19. The compiler message `Operator '*' cannot be applied to operands of type 'bool' and 'bool'` means that in the return line `isSubmitted * isValid;` you are trying to multiply logical values.

Hint: to correct this error, use the && operator, i.e. logical product.

Important! Remember that the * operator is used to multiply numbers, but cannot be applied to logical values. Check what operators are available for the bool type and consider which one should you use to return the logical product. Try again!

## Example response 3

Your code contains compilation error CS0103 on line 8. The compiler message `The name 'myVar' does not exist in the current context` means
that you are trying to use a variable myVar that has not been declared or initialized.

Hint: Before using a variable in C#, you must declare it with a type, such as `int myVar;`. Perhaps on the line you are using this variable it is not available?

Important! Declare all variables before using them to avoid compilation errors. Refine your code and try again!

## Example response 4

Compilation error CS1519 appears on line 7 with the message Invalid token 'token' in class, struct, or interface member declaration. This means that an invalid keyword was used in the line `tatic bool IsThere1(int a, int b)`.

Hint: To correct the error, remove the typo and correct the word 'tatic' to 'static'.

Important! When you see the Invalid token message, check the syntax of your code and the correctness of the keywords used to avoid compilation errors. Fingers crossed!
